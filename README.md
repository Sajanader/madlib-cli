# Madlib game:
**Mad Libs** is a phrasal template word game which our app is prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

We have three function to implement the game:
* the first on to read the text from another file which contains the text of the game.
* the second one is responsible for dividing what the use enter and another static syntax of the game.
* the third one is responsible for merging what is the user enters and the syntax of the game.
